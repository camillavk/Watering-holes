Rails is a popular web framework. Sinatra, by comparison, is a DSL, not a framework â€“ it gives you much more flexibility and fewer conventions when you're building a website. Rails is, well... like being on rails. There are fewer decisions for you to make, and more decisions that are made for you. It's 'opinionated'.

This week's project is a clone of Yelp. The goal is to introduce you to Rails, focusing especially on:

creating Rails applications
the structure of Rails apps (MVC, the router, helpers)
TDD in Rails, with RSpec & Capybara
associations
validations
AJAX in Rails
